**Homework**

**(Lesson Plan 5, Chapter 5)**

**1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?**

**2. List all the compound assignment operators.**

+=, -=, $=, /=

**3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.**

Two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5 are, &quot;var = var + 5;&quot; and &quot;var += 5&quot;; Two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50 are, &quot;var = var – 50,&quot; and var -= 50&quot;;

**4. How long does a while loop run?**

A while loop will run long as the given conditions is true.

**5. What happens if you don&#39;t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?**

If you don&#39;t change the loop variable in the body of a while loop block you will end up with an infinite loop.

**6. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of**

**  them? What happens if you omit all of them?**

**7. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?**

Write the loop as a DO statement.

**8. What does the break statement do?**

The break statement exits the loop immediately and execution continues at the first statement that follows the loop.

**9. What does the continue statement do?**

It causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately (after reevaluating the Boolean expression basically it skips the rest of the code in the loop (for that iteration).
