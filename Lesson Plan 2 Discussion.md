**Homework**

**(Lesson 2, Chapter 2)**

1. **What is a statement?**

A statement is a command that performs an action such as calculating a value and storing the result or displaying a message to a user.

1. **What is an identifier?**

Identifiers are the names that you use to identify the elements in your program.

1. **What is a variable?**

A **variable** is one type of field. The following code is a simple example of how to declare an integer **variable** , assign it a value, and then assign it a new value. ... In **C#** , **variables** are declared with a specific data type and a label.

1. **Are primitive types and value types the same thing? See page 177.**

1. **How are arithmetic operators and variable types related?**

The relation is how they work together depending on the type.

1. **How do you turn an integer into a string?**

1. **How do you turn a string into an integer?**

Call the _ToString_ method of the variable. For example:

int intVar = 42; string stringVar = intVar.ToString();

1. **What is the difference between precedence and associativity?**

Precedence rules specify priority of operators (which operators will be evaluated first, e.g. multiplication has higher precedence than addition, PEMDAS). The associativity rules tell how the operators of same precedence are grouped.

Precedence (High to low, Up to down Vice-versa)

Associativity (Left to right, side to side, vice-versa)

1. **9. How are the pre\_x and post\_x increment and decrement operators evaluated differently?**

1. **10. What is string interpolation?**

Used to construct strings. An interpolated string looks like a template string that contains _interpolated expressions_. An interpolated string returns a string that replaces the interpolated expressions that it contains with their string representations.

1. **11. What does the var keyword do?**

**C#** Programming/ **Keywords** / **var**. The **var keyword can** be used in place of a type when declaring a variable to allow the compiler to infer the type of the variable
