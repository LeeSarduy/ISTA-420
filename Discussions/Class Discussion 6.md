**Homework**

**(Lesson 6)**

1. **In your own words, what is a** _subquery_ **?**

A subquery is a query that is nested inside another query.

1. **In your own words, what is a** _self contained subquery_ **?**

It is a query that will return a single value regardless where it is

1. **In your own words, what is a** _correlated subquery_ **?**

Uses values of the outer query

1. **Give an example of a subquery that returns a single value. When would you use this kind of subquery?**

1. **Give an example of a subquery that returns multiple values. When would you use this kind of subquery?**

1. **Give an example of a subquery that returns table values. When would you use this kind of subquery?**

1. **What does the** _exists_ **predicate do? Give an example.**

1. **What happens if we use the** _not_ **operator before a predicate? Give an example.**

1. **When you use** _exists_ **or** _not exists_ **with respect to a row in a database, does it return two or three values? Explain your answer.**

The exists predicate, with or without the not operator returns one of two possible values, either true or false. Exists uses two-valued logic and not three-valued logic. If you think about it, there&#39;s no situation where it&#39;s unknown whether a query returns any rows.

1. **How would you a subquery to calculate aggregates? For example, you want to calculate yearly sales of a product, and you also want to keep a running sum of total sales. Explain how you would use a subquery to do this.**
