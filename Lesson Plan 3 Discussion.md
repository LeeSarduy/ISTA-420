**Homework**

**(Lesson 3, Chapter 2)**

1. **What is a** _method_ **?**

The method body statements are the lines of code that are run when the method is called. They are enclosed between opening and closing braces, { }.

1. **What does a** _return_ **statement do?**

A return statement causes the method to finish, and control returns to the statement that called the method, as described later in this chapter.

1. **What is an** _expression bodied_ **method?**

An expression-bodied method consists of a single expression that returns a value whose type matches the method&#39;s return type, or, for methods that return void, that performs some operation.

1. **What is the** _scope_ **of a variable?**

When a variable can be accessed at a particular location in a program, the variable is said to be in _scope_ at that location.

1. **What is an** _overloading__method_ **?**

When two identifiers have the same name and are declared in the same scope.

1. **How do you call a method that requirements** _argumets_ **?**

You provide the arguments in the parenthesis of the method call. You must supply an argument for each parameter, and the value of each argument must be compatible with the type of its corresponding parameter.

1. **How do you write a method, that is, specify the method definition, that requires a** _parameter list_ **?**

1. **How do you a parameter specify as optional when defining a method?**

You specify that a parameter is optional when you define a method by providing a default value for the parameter. You indicate a default value by using the assignment operator.

**       9. How do you pass a argument to a method as a** _named parameter_ **?**
Identifiers are the names that you use to identify the elements in your program.
What is a variable?
A variable is one type of field. The following code is a simple example of how to declare an integer variable , assign it a value, and then assign it a new value. ... In C# , variables are declared with a specific data type and a label.
Are primitive types and value types the same thing? See page 177.
How are arithmetic operators and variable types related?
The relation is how they work together depending on the type.

How do you turn an integer into a string?

How do you turn a string into an integer?

Call the ToString method of the variable. For example:
int intVar = 42; string stringVar = intVar.ToString();
What is the difference between precedence and associativity?
Precedence rules specify priority of operators (which operators will be evaluated first, e.g. multiplication has higher precedence than addition, PEMDAS). The associativity rules tell how the operators of same precedence are grouped.
Precedence (High to low, Up to down Vice-versa)
Associativity (Left to right, side to side, vice-versa)
9. How are the pre_x and post_x increment and decrement operators evaluated differently?
10. What is string interpolation?
Used to construct strings. An interpolated string looks like a
