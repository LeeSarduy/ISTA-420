**Homework**

**Lesson Plan 6**

1. **1.**** What is an **_excetion_**?**

Is basically an ERROR. Is a response to an exceptional circumstance that arises while a program is running, such as an attempt to divide by zero. **Exceptions** provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another. **C# exception** handling is built upon four keywords: try, **catch** , finally, and throw.

1. **2.**** What happens in a **_try_** block if the program executes without errors?**

The code run will continue one after the other, to completion.

1. **3.**** How does the **_catch_** mechanism work for unhandled exceptions?**

1. **4.**** What happens in a program if an **_exception block_** fails to handle an particular error?**

If, after cascading back through the list of calling methods is unable to find matching catch handler, the program will determine with an unhandled exceptions.

1. **5.**** What is the parent class for all exceptions? How does this work?**

Exception is the parent class of all exceptions. If you catch exception, the hanlder traps every possible exception that can occur.

1. **6.**** How do you determine the type of an error?**

You can determine the type of error by examining the details in the message property of the thrown exception.

1. **7.**** What is the purpose of integer checking?**

**             ** It validates user inputs.

1. **8.**** What does the **_finally_** block do?**

It ensures that a statement is always running, whether or not an exception has been thrown
